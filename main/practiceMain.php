MMU has taken over the facilities building practice space. By the end of September the practice space will reopen as The Cave. We'll have a shared drum set, PA and a bunch of other equipment to make it as easy as possible for bands to practice. The Cave will open shortly with keypad access and with page will be used to book time. Contact <a href="?page=profile&id=3">Parker Woodworth</a> with questions.
