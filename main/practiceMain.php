MMU has taken over the facilities building practice space. By the end of September the practice space will reopen under a new name - suggestions? We'll have a shared drum set, PA and a bunch of other equipment to make it as easy as possible for bands to practice. The practice space will re-open shortly with keypad access and with page will be used to book time. Contact <a href="?page=profile&id=3">Parker Woodworth</a> with questions.
